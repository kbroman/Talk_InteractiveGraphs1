### Talk: &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t all of our graphs interactive?&rdquo;

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/InteractiveGraphs).

These are slides for a talk I gave for the Department of Biostatistics
at Johns Hopkins University on 5 Oct 2012.

The slides were tested for Safari on a Mac and might look terrible in
some browsers. I have a lot more to learn about handling browser
differences.
